PDF to Audio Cat plugin for your [Cheshire cat](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core) involves converting text content in PDF files into audio (MP3,OGG,WAV), enabling you to listen to the document instead of reading it.

## How to use it?
* Install [local-cat](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/local-cat)
* Download the <b>PDF-to-Audio-Plugin</b> folder into the <b>cat/plugins</b> one. 
* Create a folder "<b>pdftomp3</b>" into the <b>cat/static</b> one.
* <b>Usage:</b> <i>pdftomp3 filename.pdf</i> - filename.pdf must be in <b>cat/static/pdftomp3</b> folder.

### Example:
<img width="85%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pazoff/PDF-to-Audio-Plugin/main/pdf-to-mp3-cat.png">

* Conversion of PDFs with too many pages (>100) could be resource intensive task and can take a long time, depending on your hardware!
